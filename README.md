# ajax.pokedexo


###  Pokedexo is an electronic device created and designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series. 

# Learning Objectives:
- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format;
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.
 
 # Exercise:
## Make a Pokédex using this API.

<p> Basic functionality that is expected (read: core features):
<p> You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
Of said pokémon you need to show:
The ID-number
An image (sprite)
At least 4 "moves"
<p> The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image. Be carefull, you cannot just do ID-1 to get the previous form, for example look into "magmar" - "magmortar". You have to use a seperate api call for this!

##  Make your web page look like a pokédex by adding a little CSS.

# Goals: 
1. Games
1. What is a Pokédex
1. How to creat one
1. National Pokédex
1. How to obtain

<p> My Goal is to create the game and learn the JS better and better. 
<p> Learn the API (Application Programming Interface)
<p> What an API does and why it exist and what are the benefits they provide in development.
